  <div class="stackedit__html"><p><strong>Thale:</strong> A small magocratic country on the north-west side of the island, its people known for their outlandish cultural traditions, unique weaponry and magical arts, and violent apathetic ways.</p>
<p><strong>Collateral Damage:</strong><br>
Thalish magic users tend to favor the practice of particularly destructive magics. Their spells tend to affect more than just their desired target, and can often even be dangerous to the caster themselves. Often, their spells are empowered by embracing the effects of ‘wild magic’, granting unpredictable, erratic effects. It’s not uncommon for a Thalish battlemage to cause the death of their allies through the use of a fireball spell against a foe in melee range.</p>
<p><strong>Sacrificial Arcana:</strong><br>
Many of Thale’s spellcasters practice a magical technique that allows them to conserve their power and spell slots, at a hefty cost to others. Whenever a caster uses this technique, they may request a willing creature within 15 feet of them to self-sacrifice, the effect and severity of which is dictated by the caster’s spellcasting modifier. If the sacrifice has any magical proficiency, they can choose to expend a spell slot to reduce the severity of the sacrifice.</p>
<p><em>In a practical example:<br>
The caster is a 5th level sorcerer, with a spellcasting modifier of +3. They wish to cast fireball, as a 3rd level spell, which would normally expend a 3rd level spell slot. By using this technique, they may have a willing creature receive three wounds in order to cast the spell without expending a spell slot, or one wound to cast the spell with a 2nd level spell slot, or anything in between. If the sacrifice chooses to expend a spell slot as part of their sacrifice, the number of wounds they receive is reduced by the level of the spell slot expended.</em></p>
<p>Thalish clerics will often make use of this technique when casting miracles or blessings as part of their service, requiring a sacrifice from the beneficiary in exchange for their blessing. Thalish battlemages will often bring with them a number of slaves, preferably slaves of hardy constitution or magical proficiency, in order to become fearsome foes on the battlefield capable of sustained magical onslaught.</p>
<p><strong>Never-ending Research:</strong><br>
Magical research has become a foundation of Thalish society, and most members of it will at some point in their lives, participate in such research, either in study, or as a subject of it. Centuries of such research have provided their society with access to many unique spells, and even more unique magical abominations.</p>
<p><strong>Thalish Slavery:</strong><br>
Slavery in some form or another has become a core part of Thalish society, with slaves, both indentured and free, consisting of nearly a third of their populace. Slaves are most commonly used as common laborers and clerical servants, but also as test subjects and… when their usefulness has come to an end… as meals for their captive abominations.</p>
<p>One would most likely find themselves first entering the slave market unwillingly, likely as a captive or prisoner for some crime or after a raid, to be sold during a seasonal auction to the highest bidder. As slaves are an expensive commodity, it is usually in the best interest of the master to keep their slaves fed and in healthy condition, and they will typically take care to do so, as long as it remains profitable. Once a slave is no longer profitable, for example, should they grow old and weak, be maimed by injury, or their purpose served, it is common for them to be branded for their service, and let free. This brand serves as a mark of status for the slave, showing their contribution to society, but also their trustworthiness and value.</p>
<p>Once freed, life is often still quite hard for a former slave, and it’s not uncommon to see them seeking out refuge and the guarantee of food and shelter by offering servitude once again to a master, becoming a willing slave. Generally, a slave will return to a master they are already familiar with, or to a master known for their kinder treatment or lighter labors, and such familiarity serves both parties.</p>
<p>Slavemasters are typically quite confident in their ability to overpower a slave, and will often not care to restrict the belongings of their slaves, unless they take special sadistic pleasure in doing so, or the slave carries items of particular value. It’s not uncommon to see especially powerful figures outnumber themselves with slaves fifteen to one, and rebellious slaves do not tend to live very long.</p>
<p>While in active duty, slaves are typically chained together by the neck, in groups of anywhere from two to fifty long, with the more valuable or trusted slaves leading the line. This is because a slaver’s punishment tends to be collective, and originate at the back of the line, causing more harm to those with lesser value.</p>
<p>Well trusted, lifelong slaves, often find themselves in positions of intrigue and power. A well-trusted and familiar slave will often be entrusted with secrets and items of great value, making work as a spy or informant easy to come by as a slave. Often, such theft and intrigue will become a profitable and often the only source of actual monetary revenue for a lifelong servant, as they are rarely paid by their masters. A slave with wealth, is a slave not worth trusting.</p>
<p><strong>Thalish Clerics:</strong><br>
While the arcane tends to be of greater focus to Thalish culture, religion still finds a place there. Great cathedrals are often raised by Thalish clerics in the name of power, greed, fear, and powerful evil dieties. The most prevalent religion among Thalish clerics is the worship of Kozah, a god of storms, power, and natural destruction. Other gods of Thalish interest exist, and are typically with similar and comparable values.</p>
<p>Thalish clerics are known for their greed, malevolence, and corruption. They often rule districts using fear and force, using violence and threats to drain wealth from the citizens, and rarely performing a service unless it would cause destruction in the name of their diety, or unless they would stand to gain in some way from it. Such clerics often use divine magic alongside arcane spells, often as an alternative path with which to perform their magic experiments.</p>
<p>Thalish cathedrals are often grand structures, erected as symbols of power and wealth at the centers of settlements, well decorated with symbols of glory, and hiding dark secrets beneath them. They are known for their lavish decor with statues and stained glass, often rumored to be the petrified remnants of whatever enemies defied their church. Flesh to Stone, and Flesh to Glass, are both favored spells of the archpriests that head them, so such rumors have some substance.</p>
